## The Team's Working Methods
Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)
Projects on github used for tracking database progress and changes so it is possible to see which stage we are on

### Scrum

- Rationale behind using Scrum
- Ceremonies we engaged in - sprint planning, standups, reviews etc. - TODO
- Use of Jira: product backlog, sprint backlog, progress tracking - TODO


## Summary of Individual Contributions
Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions

## Documentation of Sprints
Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview, timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies for absence etc)

### Sprint timeline

#### Sprint 0: Test sprint
- Timeline: 29/03 - 02/03
- Goal: Work on dependencies and get used to the scrum methodology and to Jira
- User stories completed: 
  - Landing page high fidelity design
  - Main page high fidelity design
  - Statistics page high fidelity design
  - Food item entity structure
  - Food item search
- Notes: 

#### Sprint 1: MVP
- Timeline: 07/04 - 14/04
- Goal: Create our MVP's first iteration
- User stories completed: 
   - As a user...
   - As a user...
   - As a user...
- Criteria: we used 3 criteria to decide what to include in our first iteration of the MVP. 
  1. The lean methodology which promotes the identification and testing of the riskiest assumptions.
  2. A risk/difficulty assessment to focus our efforts on high risk assumptions that are relatively easy to test.
  3. Data from our user survey to focus on the assumption that is most likely to be true.

We ranked our assumptions by order of risk and framed them as testable hypotheses. We selected the "problem" and "target segment" assumptions from our Lean Canvas (insert link) because they are the ones that can "make or break" our project. Moreover, we did not select the first (riskiest) assumption because it is dependent on the other ones and, hence, more difficult to test from the start. From the remaining assumptions, we chose number 2 because, according to our surveys, 33% of surveyees cared about food wastage due to the money associated with it. This was the largest group.

   1. We believe postgraduate students at the University of Bristol will reduce their food wastage after seeing how much they would have wasted in a year.
   2. We believe postgraduate students at the University of Bristol will input their wasted food because they care about knowing how much money they are wasting due to wasted food.
   3. We believe postgraduate students at the University of Bristol will input their wasted food because they care about knowing how much food they are wasting.
   4. We believe postgraduate students at the University of Bristol will input their wasted food because they care about knowing how much pollution they are contribution with due to wasted food.

## The team's workflow
Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout.
