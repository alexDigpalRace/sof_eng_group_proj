## Abstract

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the total direct and indirect cost of food waste stands at 2.6 trillion dollars annually. This is associated with 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 annually and enough food to feed all of the 815  million undernourished people in the world at least twice. In the UK, as in most developed countries, waste concentrates at the retail and consumer levels (as opposed to in previous stages of processing). Moreover, 70% of this waste is generated by households. Due to these two reasons, our proximity to UK end-consumers (i.e. students), and most online tools being focused on retail businesses, we have decided to centre our attention on households. Specifically, we will focus on motivating UK students to waste less food. The application developed encourages students to waste less food by putting the issue into a longer-term and more personally-relevant perspective. Particularly, after inputting how much food they have wasted in a week, they are presented with how much money they would waste in a year. TECH STUFFâ€¦. No more than 3 sentences.
