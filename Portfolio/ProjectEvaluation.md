## Reflective Discussion of The Success of The Project
Details of how you evaluated your designs (techniques used & awareness of their limitations). Description of techniques suitable for your particular design. A timeline of evaluation of your design

Unit testing / Functional testing.

User acceptance testing. Evaluation of your design with users – methods undertaken, findings, implications

Reflective discussion of the success of the project. How well did your project fulfil the brief? Were all of your own objectives met

### Reflection on Working Practices
Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc)

## Industry and Academic Review

### Academic Review

The primary goal of our application was to increase awareness of individual food waste and secondarily nudge behavior change. 

The transtheoretical model (TTM), a psychosocial model for behavior change, was applied to better understand the stages from contemplation of an issue to long-term maintenance of intended behavior. TTM has been applied in preventing ill behavior or creating new behavior in a number of contexts including smoking cessions <sup>1</sup> and exercise <sup>2</sup>.  In the context of food waste, there are 5 stages for behavior change: (1) pre-contemplation where the individual has no thought for change, (2) contemplation where the individual is awareness of the issue, (3) preparation where the individual considers or plans for behavior change, (4) action where the individual carries out the behavior and (5) maintenance where the individual adheres to the behavior for 6 months or longer <sup>3</sup>. 

Our application focuses on pre-contemplation and contemplation stages, specifically the act of weighing the pros and cons of a behavior. We apply the language of internal reconciliation to help individuals internalize the issue in their own behavior <sup>3</sup>. For example, users are asked, “Where has your money gone?” to convey the cons of money lost for them then asked, “What foods have you wasted this week?” to convey their individual contribution to the issue.  This approach is further supported by research that showed that awareness of their own behavior is needed to nudge behavior change <sup>4, 5</sup>. To push individuals towards action, we framed our messaging with social norming. For example, on the results page, the reported cost of individual food waste is compared to the average cost of food waste per individual in the UK: “That’s more waste than that of the majority of people in the UK.” We chose social norming as research has shown that this approach may nudge individuals towards reducing waste <sup>6</sup>
