# **Money Bin**

## Abstract

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the total financial, environmental, and social cost of food waste and loss stands at 2.6 trillion dollars annually. This is associated with 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 annually and enough food to the 690 million undernourished people in the world at least twice. In the UK, as in most developed countries, waste concentrates at the retail and consumer levels. Moreover, 70% of this waste is generated by households. Due to these two reasons, our proximity to UK end-consumers (i.e. students), and most online tools being focused on retail businesses, we have decided to centre our attention on households. More specifically, we will focus on motivating UK students to waste less food. The application developed encourages students to waste less food by putting the issue into a longer-term and more personally-relevant perspective. Namely, after inputting how much food they have wasted in a week, they are presented with how much money they would waste in a year. To achieve this, we designed and built a single-page application using the MEAN stack. This consists of a noSQL type database which facilitates design and integration, the Angular framework, which allows developers to build the site in components that get rendered dynamically by the browser, and Express and Node which are used used to host the web server and API, allowing communication between the usersâ€™ browser and the backend database.


## Project Objectives

-objectives, evaluation, contributions

This web application's primary objective is to increase awareness about household food waste. Moreover, it also aims to nudge people's behaviour into taking food waste more seriously and ultimately contribute to the reduction of it.
