# Dashboard

This branch is based on the work from the technical workshops.

## Development server

Thought it might be useful to have a copy of an up to date dashboard/demosite in case anyone wanted to look at my execellent work to compare with (also makes it easier to start working together).

## Worksheet:

Currently its updated to worksheet 6 - Express API worksheet

## Usage:

You should all already have this repo so dont clone it, you'll need to check out this particular remote branch to a new branch on your local machine, run the site with: ng serve -o (the -o outputs it to the default browser for you, also ctrl + c to terminate angular once you've done :)
